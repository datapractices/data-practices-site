	Today’s exercises only touch on the kickoff stage.
	While that’s only 1 out of the 7 stages, it’s arguably the most critical. Every other stage is strengthened when you kick off the project with the right stakeholders, and the right questions and goals. 
	This is also the stage that makes the most sense for design to get involved in.
	Disclaimer that in real life, you want your data team to be in the kickoff with you from the start so the process is collaborative from the start instead of a throw-it-over-the-fence situation.

	Next, we’re going to break from the group and distill the HIGH IMPACT post-its as much as possible.

	When we did this workshop at South By Southwest, Christine shared a story about working with a client who kept using the acronym SQL in a way that didn’t make sense to her. Turns out, she was thinking of the query language SQL, and the client was talking about Sales Qualified Leads. And a colleague of ours came from a company that had 7 competing definitions of the word “Enterprise;” this caused major problems for internal communication and in other areas.

   In this example, we start with the question “How might we determine which ad channels perform best?” “Perform” is nebulous. So we change it to Cost Per Acquisition, because it’s the primary way our fictional company measures ad performance and it’s calculated consistently. But even now we have an issue because it’s not really helpful to know what ad channels have the best CPAs for all time--things change. In the final version, we choose a timeframe that matches the time we have to meet our objective. We now have a question to which we can provide a useful, unambiguous answer, powered by readily available data.
	--
	As a group, review each question and see if you can refine even further.
	Is there a way to combine into a single, even clearer version? Are there really two questions competing for attention? Remove as much ambiguity as possible for every question.
